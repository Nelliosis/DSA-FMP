## Contribution Method: Branching & Pushing into Branch

2. After pulling, always branch out from main into your branch with `git checkout -b branchname`.
3. After coding, you may commit and push your changes along with the branch into the remote server with:
```
git add .
git commit -m "succint message here."
git push origin branchname
```
4. After pushing, you may issue a pull request in the pull requests tab of the repository.
   - Your title should be succint and should indicate what you want to add
   - Your comment and description should be detailed and describe the use case, the definition and the execution.

## Coding Conventions
1. Always add a comment when:
   - Defining a function. Comment near the parameter declaration and describe the functionality within 1-2 sentences.
   - Describing an algorithm.
   - Describing program flow.
   - You want to note a certain part of the program for future contributors.
2. Follow proper indentation as manipulated by your IDE.
3. Always add space between operators, parameters and lists. i.e.:
```
int x, y, z;
foo(int x, int y, int z)
if(x == y)
```
